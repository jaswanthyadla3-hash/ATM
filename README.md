# 🏦 ATM Management System (Python — OOPS Mini Project)

This project is a simple **ATM Simulation System** built using the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts in Python**.  
It demonstrates key ideas like **Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism** in a practical and easy-to-understand way.

## 🚀 Features

- ✔ Create bank accounts  
- ✔ Check account balance  
- ✔ Deposit money  
- ✔ Withdraw money (with validation)  
- ✔ ATM-style user interaction  
- ✔ Clean OOPS structure for learning

## 🧠 Concepts Used (OOPS)

- **Abstract Class** — Base blueprint for account behavior  
- **Encapsulation** — Protecting account data  
- **Inheritance** — ATM derived from Account  
- **Polymorphism** — Different transaction behaviors
